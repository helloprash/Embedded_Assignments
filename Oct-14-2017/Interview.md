#Part one

###1.When we talk about variables there is a term called "Scope of a Variable" what is it can you explain to me ?
Scope of a variable is the region or block of program in which the variable is active. The two types of variables are:
1)Local Variables: These variables are active only in its native function or block and 
		    are destroyed once the function or block finishes it's execution.
2)Global Variables: These variables are active during the execution of the entire program.

###2.We have to terms related to variables, Declaration and Defintion what are they, explain with an example
Declaration of a vairiable is telling the compiler, to what data type the variable belongs to.
Definition means allocation of memory to the declared variable.
